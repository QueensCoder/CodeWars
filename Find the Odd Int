Given an array, find the int that appears an odd number of times.

There will always be only one integer that appears an odd number of times.
"""This kata wants us to iterate through seq and find the integer that has an odd count.
  to do this we use the count() function. We count i to see if it has an odd count.
  in the second example we use list comp and use splicing to get the first number in the list.
  When using list comp if we didnt use the splice [0] it would've return [5,5,5] instead of 5.
  
  

def find_it(seq):
    for i in seq:
        if seq.count(i) % 2 != 0:
            return i
            
def find_it(seq):
  return [i for i in seq if seq.count(i) % 2 != 0][0]
