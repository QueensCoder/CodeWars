Write a function that takes an (unsigned) integer as input, and returns the number of 
bits that are equal to one in the binary representation of that number.

Example: The binary representation of 1234 is 10011010010, so the function should return 5 in this case

'''This problem wants us to return how many 1's (bits) are in the binary representation of a number.
   In our function we use bin(n) to get the binary representation of n. Then we use
   str and count('1') to count how many ones(bits) are in the representation. If you use
   count(1) instead of count('1') it will throw an error.'''
   
def count_bits(n):
  return str(bin(n)).count('1')
