Don't give me five!

In this kata you get the start number and the end number of a region and should return the count of all numbers except numbers with a 5 in it. The start and the end number are both inclusive!

Examples:

1,9 -> 1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9 -> Result 8
4,17 -> 4,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,16,17 -> Result 12
The result may contain fives. ;-)
The start number will always be smaller than the end number. Both numbers can be also negative!

I'm very curious for your solutions and the way you solve it. Maybe someone of you will find an easy pure mathematics solution.

Have fun coding it and please don't forget to vote and rank this kata! :-)

I have also created other katas. Take a look if you enjoyed this kata!


"""This kata seems easy at first but it is tricky. When using range you have range(start,stop,step). The stop is non-inclusive so
  range(1,10) gives you 1 through 9. In order to make the stop included we write range(start,stop+1). That was the easy part the not
  so simple pitfall I fell into was forgetting to use str and '5' when using a loop. When looping without '5' and str(i) the output turned
  out to be 1 more than the desired output. Don't forget to use str when iterating through a series of numbers. The rest is quite simple,
  use count and increment count according to how many numbers are not '5'."""

def dont_give_me_five(start,end):
    count = 0
    for i in range(start, end+1):
        if '5' not in str(i):
            count +=1
    return count
