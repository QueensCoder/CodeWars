x Simple, given a string of words, return the length of the shortest word(s).

String will never be empty and you do not need to account for different data types.

"""This is an easier kata. They want us to iterate through a string and find the word with the shortest length and return that length.
   ex. s = 'Which word is the shortest". We want our function to return 2. In order to iterate through each word and not each character
   we have to use .split()."""

  return min(len_list)
  
   
  OR
 
 """If you are into short one liners. Here we used list comp to make our code shorter
    list comp allows you to create the list. We included our needs of len(i) being added to the list
    and we also had to use s.split() again to ensure our function iterated through the words
    not the characters. MIND YOUR () and YOUR [] MAKE SURE THEY MATCH UP or else you'll throw errors."""
