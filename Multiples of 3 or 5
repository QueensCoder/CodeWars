If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in.

Note: If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, only count it once.
"""This problem they want you to add numbers in any range if the number is divisible by 3 or 5. If the range is 9 the numbers
   that you can add to the sum are 3,5,6,9......... 1,2,4,7,8 are not divisble by 3 or 5. In order to solve this we need to use the
   % operator which is similar to divide but it tells you if there is a remainder. for example 3 % 2 = 1.....why?
   3 divided by 2 gives you 1.5 normally but with modulo (%) it gives you 1 because there is a remainder of 1. Using modulo 
   lets you know if a number is odd or even or if a number is divisible by a specific number."""

  """much more complicated despite being shorter. we use the sum function to add all the x's in the range of number
    that are divisible by 3 or 5"""
